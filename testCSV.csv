ElmerFUDz,"M.C.A.C acquiring Playboy is gonna be huge

Playboy doesn't make magazines anymore. They completely shifted to sexual wellness, but with the brand power they have they can take several avenues to build on the success from their new business. 

**Current SPAC price implies that EV is only 10.3x '21 EBITDA. Well below competitors, but that isn't taking into account the true value here which is the brand.** Recognition is everything. With the growing success of Onlyfans, pornhub, etc as well as Wellness in general &amp; growing public acceptance/openness surrounding sexuality it leads to tons of routes the new company can take beyond what's already working. With a management team coming in that has a better grasp on revenue streams, I think the **Pro Forma EBITDA growth is actually undervalued even though it's expected to QUADRUPLE through 2025.** 

**Owners/CEO are rolling 100% of equity into the new company, showing they're dedicated and believe fully in the turnaround**

Furthermore, they have the cash and leverage to pull off some pretty big M&amp;A moves to grow top and bottom line numbers, plus **Playboy recently acquired Yandy, sexual e-commerce that they can grow beyond sex**. Or they can spend that on marketing/advertising, because as successful as they are right now, I had no clue they had moved on from magazines or what they were up to. 

The stock is barely above NAV, this is one of the few chances to get in before the rocket in the SPAC space. When more details surrounding the deal become more public and investors see the name &amp; the transition they've made it's going to blow tf up and we'll all have Playboy mansions of our own.

Given the opportunity to run a large B&amp;M, cutting expenses and liabilities is a long term, good idea.
Secondly, inventory volume of PS5/XBsX/XBsS. This is the unknown. How does Sony and Microsoft distribute to each store? Is it a set amount, and then the retailer distributes to the location? Or is it ""each store open gets 5 consoles per shipment.""if its the latter, then its not a good decision, if it the prior example, which is the example I would put money on.

&gt;How does it work? Lets say a new X Box X costs $499, the typical margin is around 10% so that is $50.

Stonksflyingup,"TWO YEARS after Target launched its $6bn operation in Canada, they decided to close the entire Canadian operation for a quarterly loss of $5.4 BILLION. The management team decided to close unprofitable locations and focus more towards online sales and their locations in the US. (Sounds like GME right now, especially what Ryan Cohen is saying)

""Target said exiting Canada would allow it to focus resources on the U.S. market. It also RAISED its estimate for adjusted earnings per share in the quarter to $1.43 to $1.47, an upward revision of 6 cents.""
Doubters had their say of course. ""The failure in Canada raises serious doubts about the retailer’s long-term growth prospects""

In 2015 the share price was $75 when they took the huge loss. Currently TGT is trading at ATH $172, up 2.5x

GME doubters will have their say, comparing the closures to Blockbuster, (just like you did now) but case studies have proven that store closures can be extremely bullish like in the case for TGT. GME made a bad business move in Europe. If they close those stores and sell off the EU assets they can generate lots of capital to fund their digital growth and protect themselves against losses.

SchindlersList1,"Hey fuckface the only thing that I want DD on from New Zealand is Lord of the Rings fun facts. Here’s why GME is so screwed:

1. Losing money hand over fist when every single gaming company is posting record numbers. Xbox, ps5 sold out. Nintendo doing their thing. Everyone stuck at home playing video games. If there was a time for them to be INCREDIBLY profitable it would be now. 

2. GME isn’t good value for gamers. True fans of gaming know that you get cash back shopping at Best Buy, or Amazon. What does GME give you other than worthless points that you can buy an anime pillow with? 

3. Don’t mistake nostalgia for “cornering the market”. They aren’t the most convenient way to shop for games anymore.. it’s an aging dinosaur on its way out. Blockbuster was a cool vibe too. Look how far that got them.",2020-12-13 21:01:39,the|GME

SPAC acquiring... Playboy🐰

Probably the fairest valuation of all SPACs right now comparative to NAV + Pro Forma rev/EBITDA multiples

No more magazines. They make sexual wellness and shit for stores + acquired Yandy which is e-commerce similar to Adam and Eve, so they can use the word omni-channel to get big investors. 

With the brand-name they can take over the whole sex industry. They have enough capital and equivalents to buy out another segment of the sex industry.. Only fans perhaps? That would be my guess for their next step in growth. 

Plus the current owners know more than anyone how the company's trajectory is shaping out and the they showed they're confident in the combined company bc they had the option to either get cash or stonks and they rolled all their equity into the new company. These dudes get bunny blowjobs DAILY they aren't cursed with the burden of making decisions on a full sack, which as we all know leads to bad decision making, so if they believe in this company growing more than the current valuation + time equity and faster than inflation, then you better believe in it too.",2020-12-13 22:03:17,the
